Welcome to themachinethatgoesping's documentation (tools)!
===================================

**themachinethatgoesping** (tmtgp or ping) is about to become a set Python libraries for enabling advanced processing strategies for multibeam and singlebeam echosounder data. This will become a common/shared tools library.

We just started, and serious development will not happen before the end of may 2022.

But if you are interested, just contact peter.urban@ugent.be

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information (future)
how to :ref:`installation` the project (future).

.. note::

   This project is under active development. Actually, as state of 05/2022 it does not really exist yet :-)
